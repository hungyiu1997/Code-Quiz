# Code-Quiz

The code quiz assignment is not completed. I ran into many difficulties and spent a lot of time reviewing class materials to catch up. I am really afraid the lack of knowledge I have about the current subject. It is totally possible that my study method is not working or else. I have to figure it out before it is too late. Rewatching class videos is certainly not enough. I shall also redo mini projects and previous class assignments to practice more. Again, it is another week of catching up. It seems that many in the class are able to follow along while I hit a wall with JavaScript. The feeling of panic is coming in as the class moves forward every week. The Udemy class I signed up for is extremely helpful, however, I am behind in the progress and not able to catch up with the class. I shall continue to improve and fix this assignment. Let's have a more positive outlook and soon you will see the light beyond the tunnel.
